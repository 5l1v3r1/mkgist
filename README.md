# mkgist

A small utility for making gists. When I need to share code snippets online, the formatting always ends up totally messed up when I copy-paste manually. This alleviates that.

## Usage

    mkgist filename [-d "description"]

The location of the created gist is printed to stdout. Gists are anonymous.
